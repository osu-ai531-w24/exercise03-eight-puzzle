# EightPuzzleBestFirstSearchSolver: A problem solver for the eight-puzzle problem
# that can apply best-first search to find a solution node. This class encapsulates
# a best-first search algorithm and an evaluation function. It encapsulates the
# application of the algorithm to the problem, and in the end can produce a
# solution, which is a list of actions.
